LinkedList Code Explanation

This document explains how the Java file LinkedList.java works. The program implements a singly linked list, a basic data structure used to store a sequence of elements.

Purpose of the Program

The goal of this program is to demonstrate how a singly linked list functions by providing methods to:
- Insert a node at the beginning
- Insert a node at the end
- Delete a node from the beginning
- Display the current elements of the list

Main Components

1. Class Node
This is a nested class inside LinkedList:

class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

- data stores the actual value
- next is a reference to the next node in the list

2. Attribute head

private Node head;

- Represents the start of the linked list
- If head is null, the list is empty

Implemented Methods

insertAtBeginning(int data)
- Creates a new node
- Makes it point to the current head
- Sets it as the new head
- Effect: Inserts an element at the start of the list

insertAtEnd(int data)
- Creates a new node
- If the list is empty, sets it as the head
- Otherwise, traverses to the end of the list and adds the node
- Effect: Appends an element at the end

deleteFromBeginning()
- Removes the first element by setting head = head.next
- If the list is empty, prints a message
- Effect: Deletes the first element in the list

display()
- Traverses the list from the head
- Prints each element followed by ->, ending with null
- Effect: Shows the current list contents

Main Method: Program Execution

public static void main(String[] args) {
    LinkedList list = new LinkedList();

    list.insertAtBeginning(10);
    list.insertAtBeginning(20);
    list.insertAtEnd(30);
    list.insertAtEnd(40);

    list.display();

    list.deleteFromBeginning();
    list.display();
}

Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The list is created and initially empty
2. 20 is added at the beginning, followed by 10. List: 20 -> 10
3. 30 and 40 are added at the end. List: 20 -> 10 -> 30 -> 40
4. display() shows the current list
5. deleteFromBeginning() removes 20. List becomes: 10 -> 30 -> 40
6. display() is called again to show the updated list

Final Notes

- The program uses object-oriented principles in Java
- Code is well-structured with reusable components
- It demonstrates basic data structure operations on a linked list

This is a simple but solid implementation to understand how dynamic memory structures like linked lists work.
