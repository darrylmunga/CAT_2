2.Differentiate between arrays and linked lists:

Allocation of Memory

Contiguous, fixed-size memory chunks are used by arrays.

With nodes connected by pointers, linked lists make use of dynamic memory.

Time of Access

Using an index, arrays offer constant-time (O(1)) access.

Because each entry in a linked list must be accessed one at a time, linear-time access (O(n)) is necessary.

Adding and Removing

Inserting or removing from the middle or beginning of an array (O(n)) slows it down.

Linked lists can be slower (O(n)) at a particular place but faster (O(1)) when inserted at the beginning.

Resizing

Arrays may need to be copied to a new array and are challenging to resize.

Linked lists do not require copying in order to expand or contract dynamically.

Use of Pointers

Pointers between elements are not used in arrays.

Pointers are used in linked lists to link one node to the next.
